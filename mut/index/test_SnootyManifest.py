A record in MongoDB is a document, which is a data structure composed\nof field and value pairs. MongoDB documents are similar to JSON\nobjects. The values of fields may include other documents, arrays,\nand arrays of documents. The advantages of using documents are: Documents correspond to native data types in many programming\nlanguages. Embedded documents and arrays reduce need for expensive joins. Dynamic schema supports fluent polymorphism. MongoDB stores documents in  collections .\nCollections are analogous to tables in relational databases. In addition to collections, MongoDB supports: Read-only  Views  (Starting in MongoDB 3.4) On-Demand Materialized Views  (Starting in MongoDB 4.2). MongoDB provides high performance data persistence. In particular, Support for embedded data models reduces I/O activity on database\nsystem. Indexes support faster queries and can include keys from embedded\ndocuments and arrays. The MongoDB Query API supports  read and write\noperations (CRUD)  as well as: Data Aggregation Text Search  and  Geospatial Queries .

MongoDB's replication facility, called  replica set , provides: A  replica set  is a group of\nMongoDB servers that maintain the same data set, providing redundancy\nand increasing data availability. automatic  failover data redundancy. MongoDB provides horizontal scalability as part of its  core \nfunctionality: Sharding  distributes data across a\ncluster of machines. Starting in 3.4, MongoDB supports creating  zones  of data based on the  shard key . In a\nbalanced cluster, MongoDB directs reads and writes covered by a zone\nonly to those shards inside the zone. See the  Zones \nmanual page for more information. MongoDB supports  multiple storage engines : In addition, MongoDB provides pluggable storage engine API that allows\nthird parties to develop storage engines for MongoDB.
